# wad-archive
Python wrapper for WAD Archive internet archive dump

## Unzipped sources
This branch has (or will have...) the tidied source that relies on the unzipped big archives as source data. It's getting a bit fiddly to keep them together in one codebase.

TODO: 
 - convert list to navigation, that opens apage displaying map, screenshots and a download link, and readme/IDGames readme if found.
 - in LH list, highlight the selected entry
 - catch and alert if archive is not found
 - TEST UNC path!!
