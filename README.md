# wad-archive
Python wrapper for WAD Archive internet archive dump

## branch 'zipped archives'
Contains code for accessing data from the double-zipped large archive files. I don't really want to maintain code that both handles the unzipped and the zipped archive. I will branch off from master again to have a clean branch that contains code that handles the UNZIPPED large archive

TODO: 
 - convert list to navigation, that opens apage displaying map, screenshots and a download link, and readme/IDGames readme if found.
 - in LH list, highlight the selected entry
 - catch and alert if archive is not found
 - TEST UNC path!!
